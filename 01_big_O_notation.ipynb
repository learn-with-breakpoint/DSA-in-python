    "# Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a measure of the computational complexity of an algorithm. It expresses the relationship between the size of the input and the time or space requirements of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Big O Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation is important because it helps predict how efficient an algorithm will be on large inputs. It is a way to quantify the scalability of an algorithm, allowing developers to make informed decisions about the performance of their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation uses the following notations to describe the complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* O(1) - constant time complexity (the algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input)\n",
    "* O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input)\n",
    "* O(n) - linear time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the input)\n",
    "* O(n log n) - linearithmic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the product of the size of the input and its logarithm)\n",
    "* O(n^2) - quadratic time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the square of the size of the input)\n",
    "* O(2^n) - exponential time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to 2 raised to the power of the size of the input)\n",
    "* O(n!) - factorial time complexity (the algorithm takes time proportional to the factorial of the size of the input)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Linear Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithm: Loop through a list of items to find a specific item.\n",
    "* Time complexity: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithm: Divide the list in half and search for the item in one of the two halves.\n",
    "* Time complexity: O(log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* When possible, use algorithms with lower time complexity to improve performance.\n",
    "* Use Big O notation to communicate the performance characteristics of your code.\n",
    "* Consider the input size when selecting an algorithm.\n",

    "## Other notations.\n",
    "Apart from Big O, there are few other notations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Big O Notation (O)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Describes the **upper bound** of an algorithm's running time. It represents the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "   - **Usage**: If an algorithm's running time is $f(n)$, it is $O(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $C$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \\leq C \\cdot g(n)$ for all $n \\geq n_0$.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If an algorithm takes at most $n^2$ operations, it is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Big Omega Notation ($\\Omega$)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Describes the **lower bound** of an algorithm's running time. It represents the best-case scenario.\n",
    "   - **Usage**: If an algorithm's running time is $f(n)$, it is $\\Omega(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $C$ and $n_0$ such that $C \\cdot g(n) \\leq f(n)$ for all $n \\geq n_0$, and also, for all $n \\geq n_0$, the equations $0 \\leq f(n) \\leq M \\cdot f(n)$.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If an algorithm takes at least $n$ operations, it is $\\Omega(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Big Theta Notation ($\\Theta$)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Describes the **tight bound** of an algorithm's running time. It represents both the upper and lower bounds.\n",
    "   - **Usage**: If an algorithm's running time is $f(n)$, it is $\\Theta(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $C_1, C_2$ and $n_0$ such that $C_1 \\cdot g(n) \\leq f(n) \\leq C_2 \\cdot g(n)$ for all $n \\geq n_0$.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If an algorithm takes exactly $n$ operations, it is $\\Theta(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- **Big O** gives an upper bound (worst-case).\n",
    "- **Big Omega** gives a lower bound (best-case).\n",
    "- **Big Theta** gives a tight bound (both upper and lower bounds).\n"
